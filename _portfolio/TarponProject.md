In 2022, the Lower Keys Guides Associations approached BTT with concerns about the declining Tarpon fishery. To strategize a plan of action, I conducted semi-structured interviews and had guides draw their fishing spots throughout their time in the fishery - a process that requires an immense amount of trust. Through the application of GIS, Python, and R, I identified spatiotemporal trends in decline and abiotic/biotic correlates of the decline. Together we strategized proposals to the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary for better waterway navigational markers to address the drastic increase in recreational boater traffic that disrupts Tarpon migrations and destroys flats/seagrass habitats.
