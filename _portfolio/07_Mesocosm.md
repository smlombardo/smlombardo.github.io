title: "Juvenile Bonefish Habitat Preference Mesocosms"
excerpt: "Nursery habitats are the foundation for healthy fish populations. Experiments to eleucidate nursery habitat preferences (e.g., seagrass, structure) can help to guide protective, restorative, or re-introduction efforts.<br/><img src='/images/Mesocosm.jpg'>"

As part of the Bonefish & Tarpon Trust / FAU Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Bonefish Reproduction Research Project, I wanted to look at benthic habitat preferences of juvenile bonefish - the structural composition of a nursery. Guiding Link Foundation intern, Mason Thurman (now Clemson Ph.D. student), we collected juvenile bonefish (<i>Albula</i> spp.) from the Indian River Lagoon, FL and conducted a quad-replicated mesocosm experiment for benthic habitat preference, inter-species shoaling preference, and predator response. Juvenile bonefish preferred unstructured (sand) and minimally structured (<i>Halodule wrightii</i> benthos, mixed-species shoaling, and still preferred unstructured bottom during predator avoidance.

Variable structure was represented by artificial seagrasses, high structure = <i>Thalassia testudinum</i> and low structure = <i>Halodule wrightii</i>, separated by corridors.

Four 4 cubic meter large-scale production research tanks were situated atop platforms with a centerdrain flowthrough saltwater system.

With the help of the whole [Ajemian lab](https://www.fisheco.org/), we tied artificial seagrass shoots in a randomized pie-grid at 250 shoots per meter squared.

Completed mesocosm structure, which took three weeks to build and six months of maintaining.
