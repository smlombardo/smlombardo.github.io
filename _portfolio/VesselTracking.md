title: "Forensic Investigation of Vessel Capsizing"
excerpt: "Particle dispersal simulations (individual based models) are often employed to predict dispersal patterns of contaminants or biologics (e.g., larvae) at sea. Here, I was contracted to recreate the trajectory of a capsized vessel.<br/><img src='/images/VesselCapsize.jpg'>"

In order to assess the probable locations of capsizing, I programmed a reverse particle dispersal simulation in the program Ichthyop using a Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM AmSeas) as the hydrodynamic backbone. Model parameters were programmed according to information provided by legal deposition documents. Multiple navigational scenarios were assessed.

Three navigational scenarios for the capsizing event and vessel drift location at time of rescue.
