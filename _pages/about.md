I am a fisheries scientist that leverages quantitative and computer programing skills to complement field studies in addressing dilemmas faced by fisheries managers and stakeholders, most often pertaining to habitat conservation. While my background is in fisheries and oceanography, I enjoy applying my skills to a wide variety of computational challenges and productions.
