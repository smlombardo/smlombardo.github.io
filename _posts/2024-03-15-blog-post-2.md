During my Ph.D., I was fortunate to be funded by and work for [Bonefish & Tarpon Trust](https://www.bonefishtarpontrust.org/). BTT is a science-based (science drives policy and advocacy) conservation non-profit that focuses on habitat and fisheries issues pertaining to the nearshore flats fisheries of the greater Caribbeanâ€”Florida, The Bahamas, Mexico, Belize, and Cuba. As such, much of my shared work is focused on Bonefish, the primary foder for fly anglers on the flats. BTT publishes a bi-annual science journal to share ongoing research and conservation efforts. Linked below is an article on Bonefish larval dispersal that I was the overseeing editor/writer for.
