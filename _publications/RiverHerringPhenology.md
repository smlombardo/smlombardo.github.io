title: "Evidence for temperature-dependent shifts in spawning times of anadromous alewife <i>Alosa pseudoharengus</i> and blueback herring <i>Alosa aestivalis</i>"

excerpt: 'Spawning migration phenology of River Herring was characterized from the 1970s through 2010s. The increased rate of warming for river waters during spring upstream migrations has resulted in earlier and condensed time spent on the spawning grounds for both species, with blueback herring being most negatively affected. These anadromous baitfish have been under a harvest moratorium in NC since 2007, and with climatic trends indicating further reduction in spawning duration and production it is unlikely that the fishery will re-open in the future.'

Abstract: We analyzed four decades of presence–absence data from a fishery-independent survey to characterize the long-term
phenology of river herring (alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus; and blueback herring, Alosa aestivalis) spawning migrations in their
southern distribution. We used logistic generalized additive models to characterize the average ingress, peak, and egress timing
of spawning. In the 2010s, alewife arrived to spawning habitat 16 days earlier and egressed 27 days earlier (peak 12 days earlier)
relative to the 1970s. Blueback herring arrived 5 days earlier and egressed 23 days earlier (peak 13 days earlier) in the 2010s
relative to the 1980s. The changes in ingress and egress timing have shortened the occurrence in spawning systems by 11 days for
alewife over four decades and 18 days for blueback herring over three decades. We found that the rate of vernal warming was
faster during 2001–2016 relative to 1973–1988 and is the most parsimonious explanation for changes in spawning phenology. The
influence of a shortened spawning season on river herring population dynamics warrants further investigation.
