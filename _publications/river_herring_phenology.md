title: "Evidence for temperature-dependent shifts in spawning times of anadromous alewife <i>Alosa pseudoharengus<i> and blueback herring <i>Alosa aestivalis<i>"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/river_herring_phenology
excerpt: 'Spawning migration phenology of River Herring was characterized from the 1970s through 2010s. The increased rate of warming for river waters during spring upstream migrations has resulted in earlier and condensed time spent on the spawning grounds for both species, with blueback herring being most negatively affected. These anadromous baitfish have been under a harvest moratorium in NC since 2007, and with climatic trends indicating further reduction in spawning duration and production it is unlikely that the fishery will re-open in the future.'
